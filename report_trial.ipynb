    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Directional statistics or circular statistics is a sub-discipline of\n",
    "statistics that deals with directions, axes and rotation. Think of it as\n",
    "a regular linear data converted into a circular data by giving it\n",
    "attributes like rotation, angle, etc. Circular statistics is a lot\n",
    "different than linear statistics. Firstly, there is no true zero.\n",
    "Namely, 0 and 360 degrees are equal. So, labeling a value as high or low\n",
    "is arbitrary. Due to these characteristics, method of analysis of this\n",
    "kind of data changes completely. The kind of data that has angles, or\n",
    "periodicity, or does not have a true zero can be labeled as directional\n",
    "data. Some of the examples include temporal periods (e.g. time of day,\n",
    "month, hour, week, etc.), compass directions, daily wind directions,\n",
    "ocean currents, etc.<sup>\\[5\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculation of mean, median and variance of a circular data is quite\n",
    "different from that in linear statistics. If given a data of angles, it\n",
    "cannot be simply averaged like it is done in linear statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method for mean calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Given angular data $(\\alpha_{1},\\ \\alpha_{2},\\ldots.,\\alpha_{n})$. Calculate the sine and\n",
    "cosine of all the angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, $X = \\ \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{\\cos\\alpha_{i}}}{N}$ and\n",
    "$Y = \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{\\sin\\alpha_{i}}}{N}$. Also,\n",
    "$\\overset{\\overline{}}{r} = \\sqrt{X^{2} + Y^{2}}$. So, mean cosine will\n",
    "be\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\cos\\overset{\\overline{}}{\\alpha} = \\frac{X}{r}$ and mean sine will be\n",
    "$\\sin\\overset{\\overline{}}{\\alpha} = \\frac{Y}{r}$. Finally, mean angle\n",
    "will be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\theta_{r} = \\arctan\\left( \\frac{\\sin\\overset{\\overline{}}{\\alpha}}{\\cos\\overset{\\overline{}}{\\alpha}} \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Decide the resultant quadrant in following way: (Figure given for\n",
    "reference)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sin +, cos + : mean angle computed directly\n",
    "\n",
    "Sin +, cos - : mean angle = $180\\  - \\ \\theta_{r}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Sin -, cos - : mean angle = $180 + \\theta_{r}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Sin -, cos +: mean angle = $360 - \\theta_{r}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Circular variance measures variation in the angles about the mean\n",
    "direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance $V = 1 - \\overset{\\overline{}}{r}$. So it ranges from 0-1. When\n",
    "the variance is 1, it means the vectors are concentrated in one\n",
    "direction. Value of 0 means the vectors are equally dispersed around the\n",
    "circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another kind of data known as *bimodal data.* When data have\n",
    "opposite angles they are said to have diametrically bimodal circular\n",
    "distributions. The mean angle of diametrically bimodal data is\n",
    "orthogonal (at right angle) to the true mean. There is a procedure\n",
    "called *angle doubling* to deal with the diametrically bimodal data. But\n",
    "this article won’t be discussing on that topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of distributions defined. Generally speaking,\n",
    "any kind of probability density function can be wrapped around the\n",
    "circumference of a circle. Von Mises distribution is one of the circular\n",
    "distributions that are defined in circular statistics and can be\n",
    "considered as analogous to normal distribution in linear statistics.\n",
    "Also, it is a close approximation to “wrapped normal” distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability density function is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f\\left( x | \\mu,\\kappa \\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi I_{o}(\\kappa)}\\exp\\left\\lbrack \\kappa\\cos{(x - \\mu)} \\right\\rbrack$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where, $I_{o}(\\kappa)$ – Modified Bessel function of zero^th^ order.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mu$ – measure of location (similar to mean in Normal distribution)\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\kappa$ – measure of concentration ( $1/\\kappa$ is analogous to\n",
    "$\\sigma^{2}$ )\n",
    "\n",
    "$I_{o}(\\kappa)$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I_{o}(x) = \\sum_{r = 0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{r!r!}\\left( \\frac{x}{2} \\right)^{2r}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\  = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}e^{x\\cos\\theta}\\text{dθ}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The above equation is the zero<sup>th<\sup> order modified Bessel function.\n",
    "\n",
    "When $\\kappa$ = 0, Von Mises distribution reduces to the uniform\n",
    "distribution. As $\\kappa$ increases, the von Mises distribution\n",
    "approaches normal distribution.\n",

    "In the right panel, as $\\kappa$ increases, the S curve will gradually\n",
    "become a straight line. That makes sense in a way, that as the\n",
    "concentration increases, the probability is more cumulated near the\n",

    "## 4. Future Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to make the package more robust so that the function can accept\n",
    "different kind of inputs. When we ran the benchmarking tests, we saw\n",
    "that our code took longer time to execute as compared to that in R. So\n",
    "we need to optimize the code in order to decrease the execution time. We\n",
    "can include other functions from the ‘circular’ package of R into\n",
    "Python.\n",
